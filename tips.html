     <h1>Here are a couple of tips to help feel and stay grateful:</h1>
     <h4>So, how can we work to develop an attitude of gratitude? </h4>
     <p>First and foremost, you have to know that developing an attitude 
         of gratitude requires conscious and constant effort because it’s 
         incredibly easy to be ungrateful.

        <dt>“And indeed, your Lord is the possessor of bounty 
        for the people, but most of them are not grateful.”</dt> 
        <dd>[Surah Naml: Verse 73] </dd></dl></p>
    <p>Ask God to give you the ability to be grateful, as Prophet Sulaiman did.  
        He prayed,
        <p class="quote" id="dua"> <dl> 
        <p id="arabic">رَبِّ أَوْزِعْنِىٓ أَنْ أَشْكُرَ نِعْمَتَكَ ٱلَّتِىٓ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَىَّ وَعَلَىٰ وَٰلِدَىَّ وَأَنْ أَعْمَلَ صَـٰلِحًا تَرْضَىٰهُ وَأَدْخِلْنِى بِرَحْمَتِكَ فِى عِبَادِكَ ٱلصَّـٰلِحِينَ</p>
        <dt>“'My Lord, enable me to be grateful for Your favor which You 
        have bestowed upon me and upon my parents and to do righteousness of which 
        You approve. And admit me by Your mercy into [the ranks of] Your righteous 
        servants.'” </dt> <dd> [Naml: 19] </dd></dl></p>

          Just imagine! He was a prophet of God and blessed 
        with so much and he asked God to give him the ability to be grateful--
        so what about us? </p>
    <p>Be grateful for small things, even if it's just for the smile someone 
        greeted you with. </p>
        
     <p class="quote"> <dl><dt>Jabir reported: The Prophet, peace and blessings be 
        upon him, said, “Whoever is not grateful for small things will not be 
        grateful for large things.”</dt> 
        <dd>[al-Firdaws lil-Daylamī 5962] </dd></dl></p>
    <p class="quote">If you think you don’t have anything to be grateful, the fact of the 
        matter is - you're not looking hard enough!  <dl><dt>“And if you should count 
        the favor [i.e., blessings] of Allah, you could not enumerate them.” </dt> 
        <dd>  [Surah Ibrahim: Verse 34]</dd></dl> </p>
    <p class="quote">Look at and learn how graittude should be expressed from the examples of the righteous people, like the 
        prophets. <dl><dt> The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, would pray until his 
        feet were swollen. It was said 
        to him, “Why do you do this when Allah has forgiven your past and future 
        sins?” The Prophet said, “Shall I not be a grateful servant?” </dt> 
        <dd> [Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī 1078, Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim 2819] </dd></dl></p>
    <p>Even when you are going through a tough time, there are things to be 
        grateful for! For example, if you are going through a very tough time 
        financially, you still have good health, air to breathe, hands and feet 
        to do work, and family to support you.</p>
    <p>Part of being grateful to God is being grateful to others in your life 
        who do you favors as well.</p> <p><dl><dt>Abu Huraira reported: The Prophet, peace 
        and blessings be upon him, said, “Whoever does not thank people has 
        not thanked Allah.”</dt> <dd>[Sunan Abī Dāwūd 4811]</dd></dl> </p>
    <p>Start a gratitude journal and write three things you are grateful for 
        daily. Write about the simple, small things in life, too. On your tough days, go back to this diary and you’ll be 
        reminded of how many things you actually have! </p>

    <p>Here is an example of a potential diary entry:</p>
    <table>
        <tr>11/30/2020</tr>
        <p></p>
        <tr>
        <th>1</th>
            <td>Clean water to drink</td></tr>
        <tr><th>2</th>
        <td>A functioning kidney</td></tr>
        <tr><th>3</th>
        <td>The ability to communicate</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>Try to llimit your time on social media. Usually, we see people eating 
        the finest foods and visiting the most beautiful places, which affects 
        us negatively. Instead of being happy for them, we tend to compare 
        their lives with ours, and become jealous and dissatisfied with what we 
        have because we are not paying attention to the blessings we have. You 
        may even need to stop following people who make you feel ungrateful 
        for what you have. Instead, look at those who have less than you, as this will make you feel intensely grateful and 
        make you realize the true worth 
        of what you have.</p>  
        <p class="quote"> <dl> <dt> The Messenger of Allah, peace 
        and blessings be upon him, said, “Look at those below you and do not 
        look at those above you, for it is the best way not to belittle the 
        favors of Allah.”</dt> <dd>[Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī 6125, Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim 2963]</dd></dl> </p>
    <p>Every time you are given the ability to be grateful, thank God for that 
        as well, because that’s a blessing in and of itself!</p>

        is itself a blessing.” </dt> <dd>[Shu’ab al-Imān 4091] </dd> </dl> </p>
