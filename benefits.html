    <h1>There are innumerable benefits of being grateful!</h1>  
    <p>Now that you recognize how important it is to be grateful, 
        you may be wondering what’s in it for you.  </p>
    <p class="quote"> 
        <dl><dt> God Almighty says, “And whoever is grateful is grateful for [the benefit of] himself. 
        And whoever denies [His favor] - then indeed, Allah is Free of need 
        and Praiseworthy.”</dt> <dd>[Surah Luqman: Verse 12]</dd></dl></p>
    <p>God doesn’t need us to thank Him for the innumerable blessings He has 
        given us. It benefits US to be grateful. When we have a grateful 
        approach to life, we start to look at obstacles coming 
        our way as a way to mold us and turn us into better people.</p>
    <p>Being grateful changes your perspective of the world. As is commonly said, 
        you can either look at the glass half empty or half full. Developing an 
        attitude of gratitude helps you appreciate even the little things in life 
        that others often ignore. </p>
    <p class="quote">God will reward those who are grateful. There is no doubt 
        about it!
        <dl><dt>“And Allah will certainly reward the grateful.” </dt> <dd> [Surah Ali ‘Imran: Verse 145]</dd></dl> </p>
    <p>Being grateful leads to contentment with one’s current circumstances and a 
        peaceful mind. Have you ever heard of the phrase “complainers are not 
        achievers”? People who complain always have a list of what’s wrong 
        in their lives and as such, don’t have time to look at what they do have 
        and how they can benefit from that. Grateful people, however, look at their situation
    and try to make the best of it.</p>
    <p>If you are grateful, God will give you even more!</p> 
    <p class="quote">
        <dl><dt>“'If you are grateful, I will surely increase you [in favor]…'”</dt> <dd>
            [Surah Ibrahim: Verse 7]</dd></dl></p>
