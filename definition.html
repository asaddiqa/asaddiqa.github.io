    <h1>What does it actually mean to be grateful?</h1>
    <p>Most of us think that we deserve whatever we have in life. 
    We don’t reflect much on who has given us everything around us, 
    as well as within us.</p>
    <p>Many of us think that gratitude is merely thanking people when they 
        do something for us. In reality, gratitude is expressed at three levels: 
    <ul id="define">
       <li>(1) at the level of the heart by acknowledging that these blessings are from God 
        and truly feeling grateful for them, </li>
        <li>(2) at the level of the tongue via verbal 
        expressions, and</li> 
        <li>(3) at the level of the limbs by using these blessings to do 
        what is in obedience to God.</li></ul></p>
    <p>For example, if you are grateful for the blessing of food, you would feel 
        grateful at the level of the heart and would say “alhamdulillah” (all praises and thanks are for 
        God alone) to express 
        gratitude at the level of the heart. Through your actions, you’d show how 
        grateful you are for that blessing. You’d use the energy from the food you consumed to pray or to help out your parents. To be grateful, you’d also make sure 
        that what you’re eating is halal (permissible).</p>
    <p>If you say you are grateful for something, but then act contrary to what is expected, 
        you’d be hypocritical in your claim. For example, if you say you are grateful for 
        your parents, but then contradict your statement by being disrespectful towards them, 
        your "gratitude" doesn’t mean much because you don’t prove it through your actions.</p>
    <p>Gratitude is such an important aspect of life that the opening chapter of the Quran 
        starts off with “Alhamdulillah”. 
        A Muslim reads this chapter (Al-Fatiha) at least 17 times a day! Many supplications, 
        like the ones for waking up and after eating, also include words of gratitude, showing us how valuable these 
        blessings (that we normally trivialize) are! Imagine how important gratitude must be for us to say “Alhamdulillah” 
        so many times a day.</p>
    <p>Gratitude isn’t just for the physical blessings we have – it's also for the intangible 
        blessings like health, time, and family.</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Ibn Abbas reported: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, 
        “There are two blessings which many people waste: health and free time.” </dt>
       <dd>[Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī 6049]</dd>
        </dl>
    </p>
    <p>There are also blessings within us like our internal organs functioning the way 
        they should be. For example, just think of those people whose lungs don’t function 
        normally – they need to be put on ventilators! Here we are, easily able to breathe 
        in the air around us without a second thought, yet not acknowledging it as a blessing!</p>
    <p>There is so much to be grateful for! In fact, we could never count all the blessings we 
    have.</p>
    <p class="quote">
        <dl><dt>God Almighty says, “And if you should count the favor [i.e., blessings] 
        of Allah, you could not enumerate them.”</dt> <dd>[Surah Ibrahim: Verse 24]</dd>
